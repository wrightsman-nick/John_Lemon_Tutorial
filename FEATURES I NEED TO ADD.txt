- Add an objective on the UI so the player knows that they have to collect the files. COMPLETE

- Add colliders to the objects in the office. COMPLETE

- perhaps add music now that a lot of it is done smoother.

- I want to add a screen at the game ending that shows "You survived with X amount of health!" and maybe something special if they flawlessly completed the level.
